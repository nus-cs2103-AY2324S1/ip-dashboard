GUI Add a GUI to the chatbot using JavaFX technology","messageBody":"In the current situation, the chatbot lacks a graphical user interface (GUI), making it less user-friendly and accessible.\n\nTo address this issue, this commit introduces a GUI to the chatbot. We have chosen to implement the GUI using JavaFX technology due to its robustness and cross-platform compatibility.\n\nThe GUI will enhance the user experience by providing an intuitive way to interact with the chatbot. Users will now have a visually appealing interface to input queries and receive responses, making the application more user-friendly.\n\nThis approach is chosen because JavaFX offers a wide range of features for building interactive and responsive interfaces. It allows us to create a seamless integration between the chatbot\u0027s functionality and the graphical interface, ensuring a cohesive user experience.\n\nAdditionally, JavaFX is well-documented and has a strong community, which will facilitate future maintenance and updates.\n\nIn summary, this commit adds a JavaFX-based GUI to the chatbot, improving its usability and overall user experience.\n\n- Tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n- GUI design follows best practices for user interface usability.\n- Dependencies updated to include JavaFX libraries.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":14,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":226,"deletions":129}}},{"hash":"5cfefa0b7dde5b2a17822e1582e03df3941de45d","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"***A-Assertions*** Use Assertions","messageBody":"In the current situation, our codebase lacks a systematic way of documenting and validating important assumptions at critical points in the code.\n\nTo address this issue, this commit introduces the use of assertions as a means of documenting and validating these assumptions. Assertions serve as checkpoints within the code, helping ensure that specific conditions or expectations are met during program execution.\n\nThe inclusion of assertions enhances the code\u0027s clarity by explicitly stating the expectations and assumptions made by the developer. This not only aids in understanding the code but also helps catch potential issues early in the development process.\n\nHere\u0027s why we\u0027re using assertions:\n\n1. **Documentation**: Assertions provide in-code documentation for crucial assumptions, making it easier for developers to understand the code\u0027s requirements and constraints.\n\n2. **Debugging**: When an assertion fails, it provides valuable information about what went wrong and where, simplifying the debugging process.\n\n3. **Safety Nets**: Assertions act as safety nets, catching unexpected conditions or bugs during testing and development, reducing the chances of releasing faulty code.\n\n4. **Maintenance**: Over time, assertions facilitate code maintenance by helping developers quickly identify the impact of changes on existing assumptions.\n\nTo implement assertions, we\u0027re using the built-in assert feature of the programming language (not JUnit assertions). This allows us to assert conditions directly in the code without introducing external dependencies. Assertions should be used judiciously, primarily for scenarios where the failure of an assumption would lead to severe issues or incorrect behavior.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of how assertions are used:\n\n```java\npublic int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n    assert divisor !\u003d 0 : \"Divisor should not be zero!\";\n    // Rest of the division logic here\n}\n","tags":["A-FullCommitMessage","A-Assertions"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":44,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"404e769070cd767a44cdfffe0243281f203e7c5c","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"A-CodeQuality","messageBody":"","tags":["A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":14,"deletions":14}}},{"hash":"fe8f77961658afa04b6ac7a03cadb077286538b2","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"***B-Reminders*** Reminders for tasks","messageBody":"In the current situation, our task management system lacks a mechanism for users to receive reminders about upcoming deadlines, which is essential for helping users stay organized and meet their commitments.\n\nTo address this issue, this commit introduces a new feature that provides reminders for tasks. Specifically, it adds an \"Upcoming Deadlines\" section to the top of the todo list. This section calculates and displays the number of days left until each task\u0027s deadline, serving as a convenient and visible reminder for users.\n\nHere\u0027s why we\u0027ve added this feature:\n\n1. **Improved Task Management**: Reminders help users keep track of their deadline dates, reducing the risk of missing important deadelines.\n\n2. **Enhanced User Experience**: The \"Upcoming Deadlines\" section adds value to our application by making it more user-friendly and efficient.\n\n3. **Increased Productivity**: Reminders promote better time management and productivity by ensuring that users are aware of their upcoming deadlines.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: Displaying the number of days left to each deadline provides users with a clear understanding of their task priorities.\n\nThe implementation of this feature includes the following:\n\n- The \"Upcoming Deadlines\" section is added to the top of the todo list interface.\n\n- A calculation is performed to determine the number of days remaining until each task\u0027s deadline.\n\nThis approach ensures that our reminder system is both informative and user-configurable, catering to different user needs and preferences.\n\nIn summary, this commit adds a valuable \"Upcoming Deadlines\" feature to our task management system, providing users with reminders for their tasks\u0027 deadlines and enhancing their overall experience.\n","tags":["BCD-Extension","B-Reminders"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":2,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":45,"deletions":7}}}]},{"date":"2023-09-20","commitResults":[{"hash":"a677af5be8ad92ea282f61847f24e5be5d3fd0e9","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Minor UI fixes","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":0,"deletions":1},"java":{"insertions":3,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"d77056b0e44717aad3f51cd6e5862834f55a1882","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge pull request #2 from ryanongwx/branch-UIFixes","messageBody":"Minor UI fixes","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"866a2130b2d06aa96666c31b0e5259bcbf62726b","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"A-UserGuide","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"md":{"insertions":77,"deletions":14}}},{"hash":"afbf623ffe624685e7a9bcd91f65ebd00b76bc48","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge pull request #3 from ryanongwx/branch-A-UserGuide","messageBody":"A-UserGuide","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"ryanongwx":{"java":1131,"md":75,"fxml":0,"sh":0,"bat":0,"gradle":15,"txt":11}},"authorContributionVariance":{"ryanongwx":30642.07},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"ryanongwx":"CS2103T-T12-4 RYAN..XIAN"}}
