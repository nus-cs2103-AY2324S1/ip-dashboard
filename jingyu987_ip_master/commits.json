Here are the steps: Start a branch branch-Level-7. Implement Level 7 while committing to that branch at appropriate points, Merge the branch back to the master branch (remember to create a merge commit i.e., no fast-forward). Git tag the merge commit in the master branch as usual (i.e., add the tag Level-7). Push the master branch, push the branch-Level-7, and push the tag, to your fork.  Advanced git users: do not delete the branch after merging.  Only merged branches are detected by the script. After merging a branch b1 to the master branch, you need to push both the master and the b1 branches to the fork. Pushing the master branch does not automatically take the b1 branch along with it just because it is already merged to the master branch.","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-7"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":2,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":80,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"8362648db4a871bcb76fd3f76c0e865fe68065c9","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 8.
