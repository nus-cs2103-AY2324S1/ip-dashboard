Here are the steps: Start a branch branch-Level-7. Implement Level 7 while committing to that branch at appropriate points, Merge the branch back to the master branch (remember to create a merge commit i.e., no fast-forward). Git tag the merge commit in the master branch as usual (i.e., add the tag Level-7). Push the master branch, push the branch-Level-7, and push the tag, to your fork.  Advanced git users: do not delete the branch after merging.  Only merged branches are detected by the script. After merging a branch b1 to the master branch, you need to push both the master and the b1 branches to the fork.
