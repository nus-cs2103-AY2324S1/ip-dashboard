The parsed dates are stored as java.time.LocalDate or java.time.LocalDateTime objects in task instances.\n\nAdditionally, the chatbot accepts dates in the yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g., 2019-10-15) and presents them in a more readable format such as MMM dd yyyy (e.g., Oct 15 2019) when displaying task details.
