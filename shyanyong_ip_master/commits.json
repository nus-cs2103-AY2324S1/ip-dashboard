Additionally, it enables the loading of task data from the hard disk during the chatbot\u0027s startup. The file name and relative path are hard-coded from the project root. The data is stored in a format designed for efficient storage and retrieval. This feature enhances the user experience by ensuring that task data persists across chatbot sessions and remains consistent even in the event of interruptions.","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-7"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":97,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"e2244219e44fb061beb1509298cb22d52068e627","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-Level-7\u0027","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]},{"date":"2023-08-30","commitResults":[{"hash":"316c6cf964d8c6a5247437e983f002259a7a4174","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level-8: Dates and Times This commit implements date and time understanding for tasks.","messageBody":"This commit enhances the chatbot\u0027s capability to intelligently interpret dates and times provided in commands. When processing task inputs like \"deadline return book /by 2/12/2019 1800\", the chatbot now comprehends the date \"2/12/2019\" as 2nd of December 2019 and the time \"1800\" as 6pm. The parsed dates are stored as java.time.LocalDate or java.time.LocalDateTime objects in task instances.\n\nAdditionally, the chatbot accepts dates in the yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g., 2019-10-15) and presents them in a more readable format such as MMM dd yyyy (e.g., Oct 15 2019) when displaying task details. This improvement elevates the user experience by enabling more natural and intuitive interaction with date and time information.\n","tags":["Level-8"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":0,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":109,"deletions":37}}},{"hash":"60b9f38fcb7f4e880183fa1543f6dd0187492e7b","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-Level-8\u0027","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"10066f92891f7237efadb02234eef54dfc134078","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"A-MoreOOP: Rewrote brotherman chatbot in OOP style.
