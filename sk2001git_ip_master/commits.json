Programme should terminate to prevent wrong exception\nmessage for the problem\n* Assert in default statement since it is a invalid task however it was\ncreated and stored , data is corrupted, should stop execution of program\n* Assert in creating task List because we return null in ParseTask\nThis results in problematic null pointer exception that\ncould possibly be caught and given the wrong description.\nProgram is no longer functioning as it should be, should terminate\n\nThe asserts are done as a way to deal with highly unlikely but\ntheoretically possible situations that could cause multiple exceptions\nand code functionality to stop working as intended.
