This format is less user-friendly and might cause confusion for users accustomed to other date formats.\n\nTo address this, I\u0027ve implemented a feature that converts the entered date from the DD-MM-YYYY format to the more widely recognized MMM DD YYYY format. This change enhances the user experience and ensures consistency in date presentation.\n\nThe chosen approach involves using date formatting libraries to transform the input date into the desired format. This method simplifies the code and reduces the risk of introducing errors in the conversion process.\n\nThis change was made to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly way of presenting dates within the application. By using a common date format, we can improve usability and reduce the potential for user misunderstandings.\n\nNo additional issues or concerns are associated with this change.
