Level-10: GUI","messageBody":"In the evolution of our chatbot, we reached a significant milestone with the introduction of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) powered by JavaFX. This GUI enhances the user experience and makes interacting with the chatbot a more enjoyable and intuitive process. Let\u0027s dive into the key components of our GUI:\n\n### Custom Font\n\nWe understand the importance of visual appeal when it comes to user interfaces. To give our chatbot a unique and engaging look, we\u0027ve incorporated a custom font that adds a touch of personality to the messages. This custom font not only improves readability but also aligns with our bot\u0027s character and identity.\n\n### Profile Pictures\n\nTo make conversations more visually engaging, we\u0027ve introduced profile pictures for both the user and the chatbot. These avatars not only add a personal touch but also help users distinguish between their own messages and those of the chatbot. It\u0027s a small detail, but it makes a significant difference in the overall user experience.\n\n### Scroll Pane\n\nAs conversations grow longer, it\u0027s essential to provide users with an easy way to navigate through the chat history. Our GUI includes a scroll pane that allows users to effortlessly scroll through past messages. This feature ensures that users can access previous conversations without any hassle, even in lengthy discussions.\n\n### Send Button\n\nTo streamline the process of sending messages, we\u0027ve implemented a convenient \"Send\" button. Users can now compose their messages, click the button, and watch their messages appear in the chat window. This simple yet effective addition minimizes the chances of accidental message submission and improves overall usability.\n\nOur Level-10 GUI represents a significant step forward in making our chatbot not just functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. We believe that these enhancements will greatly enhance the overall user experience, making interactions with our chatbot smoother and more enjoyable.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"fxml":{"insertions":8,"deletions":8},"java":{"insertions":4,"deletions":5}}},{"hash":"36a577fe3a3742f0d4ff93a6d92ea6ae0055c5a8","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge pull request #8 from lululwtv/branch-Level-10","messageBody":"Branch level 10","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"lululwtv":{"java":1116,"md":0,"fxml":39,"sh":0,"bat":3,"gradle":22,"txt":11}},"authorContributionVariance":{"lululwtv":349265.25},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"lululwtv":"CS2103T-W12-4 KHIE..DRIC"}}
